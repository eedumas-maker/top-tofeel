This will be a wonderful project.

The goal is to have an app to enter all those feels you put off, 
or to remember the ones you had that were great.

Each "feel" will be a text field with name, description, 
a "when to feel", 
a "where to feel",
and maybe a "has been felt" checkbox.

Use factory function to create the "feel" objects.

Start by making it run in console, get the logic working,
then have a bit of code that deals with DOM manipulation

For now all one javascript file, but later could modularize it (especially if I like
my DOM manip code for future projects).

Workflow from prototype to finished product:
1. barebones index.html and script.js
2.
